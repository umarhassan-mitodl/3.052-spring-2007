  caption: 'This 3D illustration of a modulus map of bone was produced using atomic
    force microscope (AFM) data on the nanomechanical spatial heterogeneity of bone
    stiffness. Simulations using this data predict markedly different biomechanical
    properties compared with a uniform material, which may serve as a design consideration
    for biologically inspired materials technologies. See Tai, K., M. Dao, S. Suresh,
    A. Palazoglu, and C. Ortiz. "Nanoscale Heterogeneity Promotes Energy Dissipation
    in Bone." _Nature Materials_ 6 (June 2007): 454-462. (Image by Prof. Christine
    Ortiz.)'
